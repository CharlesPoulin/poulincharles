# Neural Style Transfer Project

This project implements an advanced neural style transfer algorithm that combines the content of one image with the artistic style of another image.

## Overview

Neural style transfer is a fascinating technique in deep learning that applies the style of one image (like a famous painting) to the content of another image (like a photograph) while preserving the content structure.

## How It Works

The implementation uses a pre-trained VGG19 network to extract content and style features from images. The algorithm then optimizes an output image to minimize:

1. Content loss - ensuring the output maintains the structure of the content image
2. Style loss - ensuring the output adopts the style characteristics of the style image

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Feature Extraction**: VGG19 pre-trained on ImageNet
- **Loss Functions**: Custom content and style loss functions
- **Optimization**: LBFGS optimizer for image transformation

### Implementation

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import vgg19
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np

def neural_style_transfer(
    content_image_path, 
    style_image_path,
    iterations=1000,
    content_weight=1e3, 
    style_weight=1e-2
):
    # Load and preprocess images
    content_image = preprocess_image(content_image_path)
    style_image = preprocess_image(style_image_path)
    
    # Initialize with content image
    generated_image = tf.Variable(content_image)
    
    # Load VGG19 model
    model = get_model()
    
    # Extract feature layers
    content_features = get_content_features(content_image, model)
    style_features = get_style_features(style_image, model)
    
    # Optimization loop
    optimizer = tf.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=5)
    
    for i in range(iterations):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            # Calculate losses
            content_loss = compute_content_loss(content_features, generated_image, model)
            style_loss = compute_style_loss(style_features, generated_image, model)
            
            # Total loss
            total_loss = content_weight * content_loss + style_weight * style_loss
        
        # Compute gradients and apply
        grads = tape.gradient(total_loss, generated_image)
        optimizer.apply_gradients([(grads, generated_image)])
        
        # Clip pixel values to valid range
        generated_image.assign(tf.clip_by_value(generated_image, 0.0, 1.0))
        
        if i % 100 == 0:
            print(f"Iteration {i}: Loss = {total_loss:.4f}")
    
    return deprocess_image(generated_image.numpy())
```

## Results

The project achieves high-quality style transfers with a variety of content-style pairs:

- Photographs styled as Van Gogh paintings
- Landscape photos rendered in cubist style
- Portrait photos transformed to look like Renaissance paintings

## Performance Optimizations

To make the style transfer more efficient, several optimizations were implemented:

1. **Progressive resizing** - Start with smaller images and gradually increase resolution
2. **Feature map caching** - Cache style image feature maps to avoid redundant computation
3. **GPU acceleration** - TensorFlow's GPU support for faster processing
4. **Style transfer with limited training data** - Adapted to work with fewer style images

## Future Improvements

- Implementation of adaptive instance normalization for faster style transfer
- Adding user interface for interactive styling
- Extending to video style transfer
- Exploring GAN-based approaches for more diverse results

## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib for visualization
- Python 3.8
