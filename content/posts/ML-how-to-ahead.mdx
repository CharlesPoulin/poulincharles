# How to Get Ahead as a Student in ML  

## Embracing AI Without Losing the Learning

I won’t lie—AI is here to stay. But I’m not here to sell you snake oil about how it’s universally good or bad. That’s not the point. Like many powerful tools, it’s a double-edged sword. The real question is: how do we, as students, leverage AI—especially large language models (LLMs)—to improve our learning without sacrificing depth, integrity, or skill?

LLMs are now deeply embedded in the coding ecosystem. With the rise of “vibe coding,” it has become incredibly easy to paste an entire repo into your favorite model and get something back instantly. Tempting, right?

I found Andrej Karpathy’s video on how he uses LLMs insightful, and I’d recommend watching it:

Similarly, ThePrimeagen (aka AY AY A) also provides a raw take on working alongside LLMs.

But after watching these, you might wonder: *How do I get ahead while using LLMs, without giving up actual learning?*

## 1. Learn from Your Course or Book (With Help)

Let’s say you’re working through a programming textbook. Use the LLM like a mentor:

- Share your favorite code snippets with the model and ask questions about structure, style, or alternatives.  
- Ask for “Uncle Bob-style” clean code critiques—treat the LLM like your personal Uncle Backbone.  
- Build a study plan: *“I want to learn X subject by Y date. What would be an ideal roadmap?”* Then critique and revise the LLM’s response based on your goals.  

Trying to understand a hard LeetCode problem? Ask the model to walk you through it step-by-step. Then try solving a variation yourself to consolidate the concept.

## 2. Collaborate, Don’t Offload

One of the smartest uses of LLMs is in test-driven development. For example:

- Write one unit test yourself, then ask the LLM to generate similar tests for edge cases and alternate paths.  
- The model has likely seen a million similar tests, and you’ll benefit from exposure to different styles and strategies.  
- However, **don’t** just paste in messy, broken code and say *“Fix this.”* That’s not learning. That’s outsourcing.

Instead, try: *“Here’s what I tried. What’s a better structure? Why?”* Engage the LLM like a tutor, not a crutch.

## Final Thoughts

Getting ahead with LLMs is not about cheating your way through productivity. It’s about connecting your developing skills with the immense, contextual knowledge these models can offer. The goal isn’t to become dependent, but to become *augmented.*

Use AI to challenge your thinking, test your understanding, and explore perspectives you might not have considered. Keep learning, and don’t sacrifice long-term growth for short-term convenience.
